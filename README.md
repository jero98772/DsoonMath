# DsoonMath
DsoonMath is a math quiz generator with various difficulties options and operators includes the solution  
for generate a lot of  exercises

	 python exercise.py 
	 
if you are in linux and you want to create a list with problems
	 
	python lot_of_exercises.py > lot_of_exercises.txt


# what is it
is a generator of math problems from levels elections can increase the problem with function quantity() select the level and quantity select the size of problem with parameters can chioise the dificult  
     
 levelop is the  paremeter for  level for operators have math functions(log's,trigonometric functions ,angular functions,hyperbolic functions, hypotenuse ,absulute value), "+","-","*","/","%", "^", "√" , "^ (2)","^(x)","√ or ^ (m/n)"etc...

 	["+","-","*","/","%","**","(1/2)","**(2)","cos","tan","sin","acos","atan","asin","cosh","tanh","sinh","atan2","hypot","degrees","fabs"]
 
 leveDt = paremeter for level of data types is digitis dont have only level with positive data tipes (why if you have level for use this program have level for subtract) and have , the 
 leveDt=4 include const ,ints ,complex, floats,binary,hex,octals,polynomialsetc, polynomials with diferent pow
 
 limit =  paremeter for limit is quantity of digitis
     quantity(levelop= 2,leveDt=1,limit=9999)
###exaple of levels
level max sometimes it has no solution or is infinite for this problem crete a funtion
    configuration ---> expresion = quantity(levelop= 7 ,leveDt=4 ,limit=99)
	answer()

min level()
